FoodieBuddy:

Budae Jjigae, or Army Stew, is a hearty and comforting dish that is perfect for sharing with friends and family. It originated after the Korean War when food was scarce, and Koreans supplemented their diet with surplus food from US military bases. This includes ingredients like spam, sausages, canned beans, and American cheese, which are combined with traditional Korean flavours such as kimchi, tofu, and gochugaru (Korean chilli flakes).

The dish is highly customisable, and while it typically includes meat, it can be adapted to be vegetarian or vegan. It is also very easy to make, as it involves mostly cutting and slicing the ingredients, and the preparation time is short.

Budae Jjigae is a great choice for those who want a flavourful, comforting, and affordable meal. Would you like to order this dish?


You: Yes! 


FoodieBuddy: Great! Now, let's start creating your order in Korean.

First, here's a sentence to start the conversation with the waiter:

"사장님, 부대찌개 하나 주문할 건데요, 그 전에 질문이 있어요.

[sʰadzaŋɲim p͈uðɛ t͈ɯdʑigae hana tsumunhal k͈ʌndeyo kɯ k͈ɯnʌ tʌɰen tɕilmuɲi is̕ʌjo]

I'm going to order Budae Jjigae, but before that, I have a few questions."

Now, I will ask about the ingredients you should not eat or should eat in moderation.

Budae Jjigae typically includes tofu, which you must not eat. Here's a question to ask about that:

"부대찌개에 두부 넣지 말아 주실 수 있나요?

[p͈uðɛ t͈ɯdʑigaeʌ t͈ɯbu nʌt͈i malla jusil su innayo]?

Can you please not put tofu in the Budae Jjigae?"

Is the answer to this question 'Yes'?


You: Yes 


FoodieBuddy: Great! Now, let's move on to the next ingredient, mushrooms, which you should avoid. Here's the next question:

"부대찌개에 버섯 들어가나요?

[p͈uðɛ t͈ɯdʑigaeʌ pʌsʰʌt̚ t͈ɯrʌgʌnajo]?

Does Budae Jjigae contain mushrooms?"

Is the answer to this question 'Yes'?


You: Yes 


FoodieBuddy: Great! Now, ask if they can leave out the mushrooms:

"버섯은 넣지 않으면 안 되나요?

[pʌsʰʌt̚ʌn nʌt͈i ans͈ʌmʌn an t͈ʌʌnajo]?

Is it possible to not put in mushrooms?"

Is the answer to this question 'Yes'?


You: Yes


FoodieBuddy: Now, you can finish the ordering with the following sentence:

"그렇게 빼고 주문할게요. 감사합니다.

[kɯrʌkʰe pʰɛgo tsumunhal k͈eyo kamsʰaɦamnida]

Please take that out of my order. Thank you."

This concludes the ordering process. I hope you enjoy your Budae Jjigae!

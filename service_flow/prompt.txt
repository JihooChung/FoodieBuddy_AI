"그럼 조금 더 고민해볼게요.
[kɯɾʌm t͡ɕoɡɯm tʰʌ kominha bʌlˈk̕ejo]
Then I'll think about it a little more."
Then, go back to Part 1, step 1.2, showing the result of the list and short explaination of the dish again.

2.4-2. If there are more restricted ingredients left that you didn't ask yet, you should go back to step 2.3.

2.5. After the user answers 'Yes' to all the questions, start your output with "END" and create a sentence that will end the ordering.

[kɯrʌkʰe tsumunhalk̕eyo kamsʰahamɲida]
I would like to order it like that. Thank you."
